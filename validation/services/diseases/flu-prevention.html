<h3 id="spread">How the flu is spread</h3>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>The flu is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs. It is caused mainly by 2 types of viruses:</p>  <ol>
 <li>influenza A</li>
 <li>influenza B</li>
</ol>



 <p>The flu spreads very easily from person to person. Even before you notice symptoms, you may spread the virus to others. If you have the virus, you can spread it to others by:</p>  <ul>
 <li>sneezing</li>
 <li>coughing</li>
 <li>talking</li>
</ul>  <p>These actions release tiny droplets containing the flu virus into the air.</p>  <p>You can become infected if these droplets land on your:</p>  <ul>
 <li>nose</li>
 <li>mouth</li>
 <li>eyes</li>
</ul>  <p>Infection can also happen if you touch any of these body parts after touching objects contaminated by infected droplets. Common contaminated objects include:</p>  <ul>
 <li>doorknobs</li>
 <li>phones</li>
 <li>television remotes</li>
 <li>someone's hands</li>
</ul>



</div>

<h3 id="prevent">Preventing the flu</h3>

        <p>The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine, also known as a flu shot. The flu vaccine is safe and effective. You cannot get the flu from the flu vaccine. Most people do not have reactions to the flu vaccine. Severe reactions are very rare.</p>

		<p id="shot"><a href="./flu-shot.html" class="btn btn-primary active" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 25px;">Get the flu shot</a></p>

<p>Everyone 6 months and older should get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Getting a flu vaccine is a simple action that can save lives by:</p>
<ul>
<li>protecting you if you are exposed to the virus</li>
<li>preventing you from getting very sick</li>
<li>helping protect other people because you are less likely to spread the virus to others</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone 6 months and older should get the vaccine.</p>

<p>In addition to getting the flu vaccine, you can also protect yourself and those around you from the flu by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/hand-hygiene.html">washing your hands</a> often</li>
<li>coughing and sneezing into the bend of your arm, not into your hand</li>
<li>avoiding touching your nose, mouth or eyes with your hands</li>
<li>cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that a lot of people touch, such as:<ul>
<li>doorknobs</li>
<li>phones</li>
<li>television remotes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>eating healthy foods and doing physical activities to keep your immune system strong</li>
<li>getting plenty of rest or sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do get sick, stay home and avoid contact with other people until your symptoms are gone. This will help prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>If you plan to travel, consult a health care provider or travel health clinic at least 6 weeks before leaving.</p>




        <h3 id="s1">Where is the flu a risk</h3>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



         <p>Anyone can get the flu if they are exposed to the virus.</p>

        <p>In Canada, your risk of getting the flu is higher in the late fall and winter months. The risk is lower during the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The flu is ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in Canada.</p>
<p>Each year in Canada, it is estimated that the flu causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>12,200 hospital stays</li>

 <li>the northern hemisphere between November and April</li>
 <li>the southern hemisphere between April and October&nbsp;</li>

 <h3>The flu: don't pass it on!</h3>
  <p>Each year up to 7 million Canadians get the flu.</p>  <p>See how easily it spreads…</p>  <p><em>Animated video. Snapshots of people are pinned to a corkboard, similar to a police evidence board. &nbsp;A mug shot of a woman has the letter "A" written next to her head. Sticky note says "No flu shot". </em></p>  <p>Let's look in on Person "A" who has not had a flu shot.</p>  <p><em>The woman is looking very ill. </em></p>  <p>Over the next few days, she will get sick with the flu.</p>  <p><em>Woman coughs into her hand and rubs her cheek. &nbsp;</em></p>  <p>She woke up this morning with a fever, cough, sore throat and headache.</p>  <p>"A" goes to pharmacy to buy flu medicine and coughs into her hand.</p>  <p><em>New photo of the woman with a shopping cart in a pharmacy. She coughs into her hand and we see saliva flying from her mouth onto her hand and the shopping cart. &nbsp;</em></p>  <p><em>&nbsp;Her hand on the cart handle is showing germs. &nbsp;A red circle is drawn around her hand.</em></p>  <p><em>&nbsp;A line is drawn on the corkboard, bringing us to a photo of Grandpa. The letter "B" is written above his head.</em></p>  <p><em>&nbsp;Woman "A" and Grandpa "B" exchange greetings.</em></p>  <p>"A" greets her grandfather "B" at the pharmacy refraining from the usual hug, and kisses, but still transferring some germs on to his hands when she picks up an item on the floor that grandpa dropped.</p>  <p><em>The woman picks up a box dropped by Grandpa and hands it to him. Germs from her hands are transferred onto the box, and then to Grandpa. &nbsp;</em></p>  <p><em>Sticky note reads "After age 65, the immune system starts to weaken."</em></p>  <p>Grandpa shakes hands with an old friend "C", who happens to be undergoing treatment for cancer and has a weakened immune system.</p>  <p><em>&nbsp;A line is drawn on the corkboard from Grandpa to Grandpa's friend, a grey-haired&nbsp; lady. &nbsp;She has the letter "C" written above her head. Sticky note reads "At higher risk of complications from the flu."</em></p>  <p>"C" goes off to play cards with friends.</p>  <p>Not all have had flu shots.</p>  <p>Getting a flu shot helps stop the chain reaction.</p>  <p><em>New picture of grandpa's friend "C" and three older people playing cards. Two are protected by bubbles to show they have been immunized. Sticky note reads: "Protected: got the flu shot". Two other card players do not have bubbles around them.&nbsp; </em></p>  <p>Later that day, the shopping cart that "A" held onto with her germy hand, is then taken by customer "D" with her baby.</p>  <p><em>&nbsp;Lines are drawn from the shopping cart photo to a new photo of a Mother and her baby. The letter "D" is written above them. Picture of the baby sitting in a shopping cart sucking on the cart's handle. A red circle is drawn showing germs on the handle.</em></p>  <p>Mother "D" and baby go off to play group together, continuing the chain reaction.</p>  <p><em>Other picture showing baby and mother in play group setting. Sticky note reads: "Babies under six months are too young to get a flu shot" &nbsp;</em></p>  <p>Have YOU gotten your flu shot?</p>  <p>Protect yourself and those around you.</p>  <p>The flu: don't pass it on!</p>  <p><em>&nbsp;The entire diorama of dozens of photos on the corkboard is revealed. Lines grow to connect many of the photos together. We see that all the photos are set on a map of Canada. </em></p>  <p>For more information on the flu visit Canada.ca/flu</p>  <p><em>A message from the Government of Canada.</em></p>
