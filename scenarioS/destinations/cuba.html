			<summary>Safety and security</summary>
			<h2>Safety and security</h2>
			<h3>Crime</h3><p>Pickpocketing, purse snatching and assault occur. Increasingly, Canadians are victims of these crimes, especially in Havana. Theft generally occurs in crowded places such as tourist areas, markets and beaches. Be aware of theft from hotel rooms, particularly in private accommodations (<em>casas particulares</em>). Theft from cars is common.</p><p>Carry only small amounts of money and avoid showing signs of affluence, such as flashy jewelry and watches. Never carry purses and bags loosely over one shoulder. Keep electronic devices like cellphones, tablets, laptops and cameras out of sight, as they are particularly attractive to thieves. Never leave personal belongings unattended on the beach. Lock your valuables, passport and other travel documents in your hotel safe. Carry a photocopy of your passport&rsquo;s identification page at all times.</p><p>Theft of items from checked baggage at Cuban airports occurs, whereby bags, including locked suitcases, are opened and items are removed. Do not pack valuables in your checked luggage. All bags are routinely X-rayed on arrival and departure as part of normal security procedures.</p><p>Incidents of violent crime are generally associated with assaults committed during a burglary or robbery. If you are threatened by robbers, stay calm and do not resist.</p><p>Beware of hustlers (<em>jineteros</em>) who specialize in deceiving and defrauding tourists. While most swindlers speak some English or French and go out of their way to appear friendly, by offering to serve as tour guides or to facilitate the purchase of cigars, many are criminals who may resort to violence in their efforts to steal tourists&rsquo; money and other valuables.</p><p>Be cautious when withdrawing cash from automated banking machines (ABMs). Exchange currency in state-run exchange bureaus (<em>cadecas</em>) and avoid independent street vendors.</p><p>Individuals posing as bogus tour agents or taxi drivers operate throughout the country. Use established tour operators and registered taxis.</p><p>When reporting a crime to the local police, insist on receiving a <em>Comprobante de Denuncia</em>, which is a document confirming that a report has been filed. Police officers may speak only Spanish.</p><p>Never pick up hitchhikers, as doing so could put you at risk.</p><h3>Women&rsquo;s safety</h3><p>Sexual assaults against foreign women occur. Consult our publication entitled <a title="" href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/her-own-way">Her Own Way: A Woman&rsquo;s Safe-Travel Guide</a> for travel safety information for Canadian women.</p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Protests occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media. Participating in demonstrations is illegal.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Avoid driving in Cuba, as conditions can be hazardous. The principal east&ndash;west highways are in fair condition but lack sufficient lighting. Most secondary streets and roads are poorly lit and inadequately maintained. Road signs are scarce and confusing.</p><p>Motor vehicles accidents are now the leading cause of accidental death in Cuba. If you must drive, do so defensively at all times. Some cars and most bicycles do not have running lights. Pedestrians and horse-drawn carts use the middle of the road and do not readily give way to oncoming vehicles. Roaming animals pose a risk. Most Cuban cars are old, are in poor condition and lack standard safety equipment. Inoperable vehicles are often left on the road until repaired.</p><p>See <a title="" href="#laws">Laws & culture</a> for important information about vehicle rentals and accidents.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>City buses are overcrowded and poorly maintained, and bus service is sporadic. Tour companies offer good bus service between airports and the all-inclusive resorts. Buses used for organized day trips from hotels are in good condition.</p><p>Official taxis are generally reliable. Avoid unlicensed private taxis as well as old-model private vehicles offered as taxis. The latter are not equipped with standard safety features and there is no insurance coverage for passengers in case of an accident. Yellow, three-wheeled Coco taxis are unsafe and should be avoided.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">General information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p><h3>General security information</h3><p>Unscheduled electric power surges and outages are common. Most tourist resorts are equipped with generators.</p><p>Telephone communication is a problem. Calls are often not answered, even at major institutions. Technical problems also exist as the telecommunications system is antiquated and unreliable. Calls may be connected to a different number than the one dialled. It often takes repeated tries to place a call to another city. Reliable cell phone service is available in most major cities. Cell phones compatible with North American standards can be used in Cuba. Canadian cell phones generally function. You may arrange for cell phone service by contacting Cubacel at +53 05 264 2266. See <a title="" href="#laws">Laws</a> for information about Global Positioning Systems.</p>

The tourist card is generally provided by tour operators or airlines (the cost is sometimes included in the price of the plane ticket or holiday package), or it can be obtained from a Cuban government office in Canada in the case of privately organized flights. It can also be purchased at certain airports in Canada.

All health insurance policies are recognized, except those issued by U.S. insurance companies, as U.S. firms cannot provide coverage in Cuba.

It is highly recommended that you purchase supplemental health insurance. For additional details, please consult the Embassy of Cuba in Canada.</p><!-- END supplemental_health_insurance --><!-- START health_screening --><h3>Health screening</h3><p>You may be subjected to a medical examination when you enter or exit Cuba, or when reporting for domestic flights. In some cases, you may be quarantined for up to seven days for medical observation if you are believed to have symptoms of a serious illness, such as from the Dengue, Ebola, H1N1 and Zika viruses, if you have come in contact with a suspected carrier of one of these viruses or if you&rsquo;re arriving from a country with known epidemic.</p><!-- END health_screening --><h3>Dual citizenship</h3><!-- START dual_citizenship_ee --><p>Canadians with Cuban citizenship&nbsp;are required by Cuban authorities to enter Cuba on their valid Cuban passport. Canadian travellers born in Cuba (regardless of current citizenship) should contact a Cuban government office in Canada to ensure compliance with Cuban regulations.

Medical professionals are generally competent. Emergency and ambulance services are very limited and response times are slow, especially in rural areas. Psychiatric care facilities are extremely limited and there are no hotlines available for this type of care.</p><p>Physicians are available at most hotels and/or at international clinics located in tourist areas to provide initial emergency medical care reserved for foreigners. In Havana, the Cira Garc&iacute;a Central Clinic (located at Calle 20, No. 4101, corner of Avenida 41, Playa, tel.: 7204 2668 or 7204 2489) offers health services to foreigners, but may occasionally experience limited capacity. During those times, foreign patients may be referred or transferred to hospitals serving Cuban nationals. Such facilities may be of modest condition or in need of repair. They may lack basic drugs and equipment, and may reflect&nbsp;hygiene practices that are different than those in Canada.</p><p>You should purchase the best travel insurance you can afford prior to your departure, as your provincial plan may cover only part of the cost of treatment and may not pay the bill in advance of treatment, which is required by most hospitals. Your insurance should include health, life and disability coverage. Ensure you have sufficient funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and medical evacuation, if required, as some private insurers require you to pay costs up-front and be reimbursed later. Check with your insurance company for payment/reimbursement procedures. See <a title="" href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/travel-insurance">Travel insurance</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p><p>Consult <a title="" href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/well-on-your-way#if_things_go_wrong">Well on Your Way&mdash;A Canadian&rsquo;s Guide to Healthy Travel Abroad</a> for other travel health tips.</p><h3>Prescription drugs</h3><p>Canadians with prescription medications are responsible for determining whether or not their medication is prohibited in Cuba. They should bring sufficient quantities of prescription drugs with them. Medications should be kept in the original container and packed in carry-on luggage. As pharmacies sometimes run out of stock, visitors should also bring basic medicine, particularly if travelling to outlying areas.</p><h3>Medical tourism</h3><p><span>Consult&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/care-abroad">Receiving Medical Care in Other Countries</a><span class="apple">&nbsp;</span>if you are contemplating undergoing a medical procedure in Cuba.</span></p><h3>Fumigation</h3><p class="clear">Cuban public health authorities continue to implement insect control measures, including fumigation and aerial spraying. The toxic fumigants can cause discomfort if inhaled. You are advised to stay indoors if fumigation is being carried out nearby.</p><h3 class="clear">Death abroad</h3><p class="clear">Standards of mortuary services in Cuba differ from those in Canada. Timelines for the repatriation of human remains are long and delays occur at any stage. There is one funeral home and one morgue in the country, both located in Havana; only these facilities have the authorization to issue appropriate documentation to accompany human remains. The capacity for refrigeration is limited and embalming materials and techniques are unlike those in Canada. Embalming may not be an option in some circumstances. Coffins, metal caskets and wooden crates are of limited availability and quality. Autopsies are mandatory and cultural and religious beliefs are not taken into consideration. Ensure your insurance coverage includes the repatriation of human remains.</p><p class="clear">Consult the <a title="" href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/death-abroad-factsheet">Death Abroad Factsheet</a> for more information.</p><!-- PHAC Data Start2 --><h3>Keep in Mind...</h3><p>The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.</p><p>Be prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada.

The blood alcohol content limit for drivers in Cuba is .04 percent (40 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood).</p><p>Drivers found to bear responsibility in traffic accidents resulting in serious injury or death are subject to prison terms of up to 10 years.</p><p>Avoid military zones and any other restricted or heavily guarded areas. Note that these areas are not always identified. Photographing military and police installations or personnel and harbour, rail and airport facilities is forbidden.</p><p>All electronic devices with GPS technology, including cellular telephones, are illegal and may be confiscated upon entry to Cuba.</p><!-- END laws --><!-- START cuban_criminal_justice --><h3>Cuban criminal justice</h3><p>The criminal justice system in Cuba differs significantly from that in Canada. Charges are not laid until the investigation is complete, and the accused may be jailed during the entire period of investigation. Canadians who have been arrested, even for a minor incident, should expect long delays to resolve their cases and may not be allowed to leave the country. Canadian consular officials may be accompanied by Cuban authorities during visits with Canadians who have been arrested or detained.</p><p>Cuba&rsquo;s constitution allows the death penalty, but since 2003, the country has effectively had a moratorium on carrying out death sentences.</p><!-- END cuban_criminal_justice --><!-- START sex_tourism --><h3>Sex tourism</h3><p>Cuba is actively working to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists, including Canadians, have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors aged 16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years. Release on bail before trial is unlikely.</p><!-- END sex_tourism --><!-- START dual_citizenship_lc --><h3>Dual citizenship</h3><p>Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Cuba.</p><p>If local authorities consider you a citizen of Cuba, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.</p><p><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship">General information for travellers with dual citizenship</a></p><!-- END dual_citizenship_lc --><!-- START driving --><h3>Driving</h3><h4>Traffic accidents</h4><p>Traffic accidents are a frequent cause of arrest and detention of Canadians in Cuba. Accidents resulting in death or injury are treated as crimes, and the onus is on the driver to prove innocence. Regardless of the nature of the accident, it can take five months to a year for a case to go to trial. In most cases, the driver will not be allowed to leave Cuba until the trial has taken place. In some cases, the driver will be imprisoned during this delay.</p><h4>Vehicle rentals</h4><p>Be cautious if you rent a vehicle in Cuba. Although insurance is offered, coverage differs from that in Canada. Contract agreements do not cover occasional drivers; therefore, the signatory is responsible for all people driving the vehicle. If you are found to be at fault in any way in an accident, the rental agency will nullify your coverage and seek damages to cover the cost of repairs, which can be very high. Rental agencies are government-controlled and Cuban authorities can prohibit you from leaving the country unless the rental agency receives payment or until all claims associated with an accident are settled.</p><p>When returning a rented vehicle, make sure to obtain a receipt.</p><p>Avoid renting scooters, as thieves target them and you may be responsible for the cost of their replacement.</p><!-- END driving --><!-- START boat_traffic --><h3>Boat traffic</h3><p>The U.S. government closely monitors boat traffic in the Straits of Florida. U.S. officials will seize any vessel not bearing a licence from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) if they believe it is headed for Cuba. Canadians who dock their Canadian-registered boats in Florida are subject to these measures, whereas those Canadian boats simply en route to Cuba via the U.S. will be exempt. However, expect to be thoroughly searched and questioned if you are in the latter category.</p><!-- END boat_traffic --><!-- START imports_and_exports --><h3>Imports and exports</h3><p>Tourists are allowed to enter Cuba with a maximum of 30 kg of personal effects and 10 kg of medicine, duty free. Personal effects include new or used articles one might reasonably need for a holiday. Cuban customs officials may seize any imported item that they do not consider to be for the tourist&rsquo;s personal use and may apply steep tariffs for personal baggage exceeding 30 kg or 10 kg of medication.</p><p>You may export up to 20 cigars from Cuba without documentation or up to 50 cigars if they are in their original container, closed and sealed with the official hologram. If exceeding these amounts, you must provide a guarantee of origin certificate. Failure to comply with this regulation will lead to the seizure of the cigars without compensation.</p><p>Art objects (including artifacts and paintings) purchased in Cuba must be accompanied by an export permit (usually provided by state-owned galleries). Otherwise, items must be registered with the Registro Nacional de Bienes Culturales in Vedada, Havana, at Calle 17, No. 1009 e/10 y 12 (call +53 7 833 9658).</p><p>It is forbidden to leave Cuba with illegal purchases. Authorities can impose heavy fines and require the offender to pay before leaving the country.</p><p>For detailed information on import and export requirements, please consult the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aduana.co.cu/">Cuban Customs Administration</a>.</p><!-- END imports_and_exports --><!-- START black_market --><h3>Black market</h3><p>Travellers may be approached and offered black-market goods, such as cigars, or asked to change dollars for Cuban pesos. Engaging in black-market transactions is illegal and can lead to difficulties with the Cuban authorities. Never transport packages for strangers. Pack all luggage yourself.</p><!-- END black_market --><!-- START marriage --><h3>Marriage</h3><p>Canadians wishing to marry in Cuba, including to a Cuban national, should consult the <a href="http://www.cubadiplomatica.cu/canada/EN/Mission/Embassy.aspx">Embassy of Cuba in Canada</a> for information on documents and procedures, and consult the <a title="" href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/marriage-overseas">Marriage overseas factsheet</a> for more information.</p><!-- END marriage --><!-- START money --><h3>Money</h3><p>Cuba has two official currencies: the Cuban convertible peso (CUC) and the Cuban national peso (CUP, also known as <em>moneda nacional</em>). Transactions involving foreigners almost always take place in CUCs. You should familiarize yourself with the CUP, since it is a common scam for merchants to give change in CUP instead of CUC. The CUC is worth substantially more than the CUP.</p><!-- END money --><!-- START accessing_funds_in_cuba --><h3>Accessing funds in Cuba</h3><p>Canadians often encounter problems accessing funds while in Cuba. Debit cards and money transfers are not widely accepted in Cuba. Credit cards issued by U.S. financial institutions, such as American Express, and some credit cards issued by Canadian financial institutions affiliated with U.S. banks, are not accepted. Other credit cards are generally accepted at major establishments such as state-run banks, hotels and restaurants and international resort chains. You may be charged a credit card fee by local businesses. Private restaurants (<em>paladares</em>) and private guest houses (<em>casas particulares</em>) do not accept credit cards of any kind. Credit card cash advances (in CUCs) may be obtained at banks, hotels or a state-run <em>cadeca</em> (exchange house).</p><p>ABMs are rare and do not always work in Cuba. In Havana, cash advances in CUCs from Visa cards can be obtained from ABMs located in a Metropolitan bank, the Miramar Trade Centre and in some hotels and stores. In Varadero, ABMs are located in the Plaza America and at banks. If you use an ABM, do so during business hours at a location inside a bank or large commercial building. Leave copies of your card numbers with a family member in case of emergency.</p><p>Most foreign currencies can be exchanged at cadecas, found in Cuba&rsquo;s international airports and in urban areas, as well as in banks and major hotels. Canadian currency (cash and traveller&rsquo;s cheques) may be exchanged for CUC without fees. American Express traveller&rsquo;s cheques are accepted at certain banks and some hotels. Keep receipts for traveller&rsquo;s cheques.</p><p>Exchange of U.S. currency is possible, but is subject to a 10-percent fee.</p><p>It is not possible to exchange CUCs outside of Cuba. It is against Cuban law to remove CUCs from Cuba. They can be exchanged for any available hard currency, such as Canadian or U.S. dollars, (if available) at international airports before leaving the country.</p><!-- END accessing_funds_in_cuba -->

					<b>Exercise normal security precautions</b>
					<p>There are no significant safety and security concerns. The overall safety and security situation is similar to that of Canada. You should take normal security precautions.</p>
					<b>Exercise a high degree of caution</b>
					<p>There are identifiable safety and security concerns or the safety and security situation could change with little notice. You should exercise a high degree of caution at all times, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>
					<section class="alert alert-danger">
						 <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The two levels below are official Government of Canada Travel Advisories and are issued when the safety and security of Canadians travelling or living in the country may be compromised.</p>
					</section>
					<b>Avoid non-essential travel</b>
					<p>There are specific safety and security concerns that could put you at risk. You should reconsider your need to travel to the country, territory or region. If you are already in the country, territory or region, you should reconsider whether or not you really need to be there. If not, you should consider leaving while it is still safe to do so. It is up to you to decide what &ldquo;non-essential travel&rdquo; means, based on family or business requirements, knowledge of or familiarity with a country, territory or region, and other factors.</p>
					<b>Avoid all travel</b>
					<p>There is an extreme risk to your personal safety and security. You should not travel to this country, territory or region. If you are already in the country, territory or region, you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.</p>
